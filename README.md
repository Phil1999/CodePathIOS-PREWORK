## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Apollo for Reddit

Browsing experience: The UI of Apollo is clean and intuitive. It makes browsing Reddit a much more pleasant experience.
Media viewer: The built-in media viewer is impressive. It allows you to view images, GIFs, Imgur albums, and videos from most popular sites without leaving the app.

2. Spotify

Playlist curation: Spotifyâ€™s algorithms for generating playlists based on my listening habits are fantastic. I have discovered a lot of new music that I love this way.
Cross-platform listening: I can start listening to a song on my computer, then continue right where I left off on my mobile device. This seamless transition makes for a superior user experience.

3. Alarmy

"Photo Mode" alarm off method: This feature forces you to get out of bed and take a photo of a specific place to turn off the alarm. It ensures that I actually get up and not just snooze the alarm.
Alarm profiles: The ability to create different alarm profiles for different days is extremely helpful. It helps me set my schedule easily without having to adjust alarm times constantly.

For my personal app, I'd like to build a Pomodoro Timer that I can easily use on my Iphone that will notify me during study/break periods. The features i'd like it to have are adjustable study/break timings, counting number of pomodoros, and as a challenge, i'd like it to have changeable settings and a popout view.
